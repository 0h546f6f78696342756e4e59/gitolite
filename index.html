<h1>Hosting git repositories</h1>

<p>Gitolite allows you to setup git hosting on a central server, with
fine-grained access control and many (many!) more powerful features.</p>

<p><a name="qi"></a></p>

<h2>quick install</h2>

<p>If you're comfortable with Unix and ssh, the following steps should work.</p>

<ul>
<li>create a user called <code>git</code>.  Login to this user.</li>
<li>copy your ssh pubkey from your workstation.  Rename it to <code>YourName.pub</code>.</li>
<li><p>now run these commands:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
gitolite/src/gl-system-install
gl-setup ~/YourName.pub
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>You're done.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: do <strong>NOT</strong> add repos or users directly on the server!  You MUST
manage the server by cloning the special 'gitolite-admin' repo on your
workstation (<code>git clone git@server:gitolite-admin</code>), making changes, and
pushing them.  Here's how to <a href="add.html" title="adding users and repos">add users and repos</a>.</p>

<h2>what should you read?</h2>

<p>The complete online documentation for gitolite is
<a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite">here</a>.  There's a lot of it, so here're
some reading suggestions.</p>

<p>If you're a <strong>user</strong> (i.e., not a gitolite admin), you only need <a href="user.html" title="what users (not admins) need to know about gitolite">this</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the suggested reading order is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>quick intro</strong>: this document, or at least the "<a href="index.html#gl_what" title="what is gitolite?">what is
gitolite</a>" section just below this one.</li>
<li><strong>installation</strong>: if the <a href="index.html#qi" title="quick install">quick install</a> above did not work for you,
then read the <a href="install.html" title="gitolite installation">INSTALL</a> document.  The "<a href="install.html#insttrouble" title="if you run into trouble...">trouble</a>"
section in it may be useful too.</li>
<li><strong>basic</strong> administration tasks: <a href="add.html" title="adding users and repos">adding users and repos</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you have to use more features, look in the master table of contents
(there's a link to it at the top of <em>every</em> document), and use your browser's
search function to search for stuff.</p>

<h2>what is gitolite?</h2>

<p>Gitolite is an access control layer on top of git.  Here's an "executive
summary":</p>

<ul>
<li>use a single unix user ("real" user) on the server</li>
<li>provide access to many gitolite users
<ul>
<li>they are not "real" users</li>
<li>they do not get shell access</li>
</ul></li>
<li>control access to many git repositories
<ul>
<li>read access controlled at the repo level</li>
<li>write access controlled at the branch/tag/file/directory level,
including who can rewind, create, and delete branches/tags</li>
</ul></li>
<li>can be installed without root access, assuming git and perl are already
installed</li>
<li>authentication is most commonly done using sshd, but you can also use
httpd if you prefer (this may require root access).</li>
<li>several other neat features, too many to list here</li>
</ul>

<h2>why is gitolite needed?: <a href="_need.html" title="why is gitolite needed?">Link</a></h2>


<p><a name="_why_did_I_write_it_"></a></p>

<h2>why did I write it?</h2>

<p>The most important feature I needed was <strong>per-branch permissions</strong>.  This is
pretty much mandatory in a corporate environment, and is almost the single
reason I started <em>thinking</em> about writing gitolite.</p>

<p>It's not just "read-only" versus "read-write".  Rewinding a branch (aka "non
fast forward push") is potentially dangerous, but sometimes needed.  So is
deleting a branch (which is really just an extreme form of rewind).  I needed
something in between allowing anyone to do it (the default) and disabling it
completely (<code>receive.denyNonFastForwards</code> or <code>receive.denyDeletes</code>).</p>

<h3>some more features: <a href="_morefeatures.html" title="some more features">Link</a></h3>


<p><a name="_security"></a></p>

<h2>security</h2>

<p>Due to the environment in which this was created and the need it fills, I
consider this a "security" program, albeit a very modest one.</p>

<p>The first person to find a hole that allows a non-admin user to push a change
to a repository that he is not allowed to, will get a modest reward of 5000
INR.  The hole should not require enabling any of the options listed as having
a <a href="rc.html#rcsecurity" title="variables with a security impact">security impact</a> in the rc file, nor obvious things like setting
the umask too loose, etc.</p>
