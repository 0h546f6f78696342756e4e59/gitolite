There are 5 files you need to touch/copy 

    example.conf
    example.gitosis-lite.rc
    gl-auth-command
    gl-compile-conf
    update-hook.pl

1.  copy `example.gitosis-lite.rc` as `~/.gitosis-lite.rc`.  This location is
    fixed for now (maybe later I'll change it to a "git config" variable).

2.  edit `~/.gitosis-lite.rc` and change all the paths however you want.  Be
    sure to keep the perl syntax -- you *don't* have to know perl to do so,
    it's fairly easy to guess in this limited case.

3.  copy `example.conf` to whatever path you specified for `GL_CONF` in the rc
    file in step 2.  By default it is `~/.gitosis-lite/gitosis-lite.conf`.

    Edit the file as you wish.  The comments in the file ought to be clear
    enough but let me know if not

4.  create directories for whatever you named in `GL_KEYDIR` and `REPO_BASE`
    (default `~/.gitosis-lite/keydir` and `~/repositories`)

5.  copy `update-hook.pl` to `$GL_ADMINDIR` (default `~/.gitosis-lite`)
