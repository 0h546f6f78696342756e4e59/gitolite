<h1>the access control file <code>gitolite.conf</code></h1>

<p>Gitolite has an advanced access control language that is designed to be
powerful but easy to use.  Other objectives were that it should be even easier
to read, review and audit the rules, and it should scale to thousands of repos
and users.  There was also, in the author's mind, a desperate need to create
something as different as possible from the brain-dead, nausea-inducing
"Windows INI" style syntax that some other popular tools seem to favour.</p>

<p>This document describes the syntax and semantics of the access control rules
and other configuration directives in the <code>gitolite.conf</code> file.</p>

<p><a name="syntax"></a></p>

<h2>syntax</h2>

<p>In general, everything is <strong>space separated</strong>; there are no commas,
semicolons, etc., in the syntax.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong> are in the usual shell-ish style.</p>

<p><strong>User names</strong> and <strong>repo names</strong> are as simple as possible; they must start
with an alphanumeric, but after that they can also contain <code>.</code>, <code>_</code>, or <code>-</code>.</p>

<p>Usernames can optionally be followed by an <code>@</code> and a domainname containing at
least one <code>.</code> (this allows you to use an email address as someone's username).
Reponames can contain <code>/</code> characters (this allows you to put your repos in a
tree-structure for convenience)</p>

<p><a name="continuation_lines_"></a></p>

<h3>continuation lines</h3>

<p>There are no continuation lines -- gitolite does not process C-style
backslash-escaped newlines as anything special.  However, the section on
"groups" will tell you how you can break up large lists of names in a group
definition into multiple lines.</p>

<p><a name="include_files_"></a></p>

<h3>include files</h3>

<p>Gitolite allows you to break up the configuration into multiple files and
include them in the main file for convenience.</p>

<pre><code>include     "foo.conf"
</code></pre>

<p>will include the contents of the file "foo.conf" from the same directory as
the main config file.  You can also use an absolute path if you like, although
in the interests of cloning the admin-repo sanely you should avoid doing this!</p>

<p>You can also use a glob, as in:</p>

<pre><code>include     "*.conf"
</code></pre>

<p>which will include all the ".conf" files from the directory in which the main
config file exists.</p>

<p>Files that have been already processed once are skipped, with a warning.</p>

related to <code>include</code>, is documented <a href="deleg.html#subconf" title="the subconf command">here</a>.</font></p>

<p><a name="summary_permissions_"></a></p>

<h2>summary: permissions</h2>

<p>The full set of permissions, in regex syntax: <code>-|R|RW+?C?D?</code>.  This expands to
one of <code>-</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>RW</code>, <code>RW+</code>, <code>RWC</code>, <code>RW+C</code>, <code>RWD</code>, <code>RW+D</code>, <code>RWCD</code>, or
<code>RW+CD</code>.  and by now you know what they all mean.</p>

<p>[Side note: There is one more very important permissions to be dealt with --
the standalone <code>C</code>, which is not really a "ref" level permission and can be
found in doc/wildcard-repositories.mkd.]</p>
