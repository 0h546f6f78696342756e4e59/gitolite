This branch contains important post-v2.0.3 commits, backported to v2.0.3,
which is the version that k.o is using.

Since k.o is auditing the code, this makes it easier to keep it in "audited"
status, at least until they need something that just cannot be backported and
they have to upgrade (at which point a full audit may again be needed).

This may also be useful for others like Fedora and KDE, who can benefit from
the security audits that k.o folks do on the gitolite code.
